# AbstractionLayerExample
An example application that uses the AbstractionLayer

The `appCode` folder is your main application that uses the abstraction layer. The abstraction layer is included in directory structure as a submodule. You may want to fork it
so that you can customize the modules.

The `AbstractionLayer` is included in the project by a `include` in the `CMakeLists.txt` of your main application.
